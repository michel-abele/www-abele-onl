                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p class="mb-2 justify">As a trained computer scientist and freight forwarding agent, my heart equally belongs to both professions. I am fascinated by the connection between these seemingly different fields because they share similarities that are often overlooked.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2 justify">In both professions, the smooth transportation is central. As a computer scientist, I ensure that data is transferred securely and efficiently from one point to another. Similarly, as a freight forwarding agent, I take care that goods reach their destination on time and intact.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2 justify">Both data transmission and goods transport require precise planning and organization. In computer science as well as in freight forwarding, process optimization is crucial for ensuring smooth operations.</p>
                    <p class="justify">The parallels between these two professions have shown me how versatile and interconnected the worlds of technology and logistics are. This realization drives me to continually search for innovative solutions that create real value in both the digital and physical realms.</p>
